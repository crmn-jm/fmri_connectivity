Exploring The Bilingual Advantage: Machine Learning Study of Resting-State Brain Connectivity

This repository contains the MATLAB code from the paper entitled "Exploring The Bilingual Advantage: Machine Learning Study of Resting-State Brain Connectivity" for analyzing connectivity matrices in neuroimaging studies, particularly for comparing group differences (e.g., monolinguals vs. bilinguals). The code includes preprocessing, statistical tests and classification.
